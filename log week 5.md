# what I was trying to do
I tried to work on the KoBoToolbox assignment and read the readings.

## how it might connect to other research I'm doing

Honestly, the biggest connections I can make to the topics of this week's work is to my sociology course from last year which talked extensively on how instituitions and practices (such as the Archaeological community and the use of digital databases) can negatively affect certain groups without any intentions to do so.

## what I did

+ Listened to podcast
	+ gained knowledge of what to do for the week and general knowledge about digital archaeology
+ read the readings
	+ basic understanding of reading topics gained
+ Tried to modify the form
	+ failed to recieve my confirmation email for my account



## challenges 
The only challenges I faced was that I had to work 8 hours every day this week and thus had little enough time when I tried to begin to work on the Modify form tutorial I still haven't gotten a confirmation email back to set up my KoBoToolbox account.
## thoughts on where to go next

Once I get my account up and running I will try and do the tutorial, hopefully it is just a time thing and not some larger issue.
