 "'What gets counted counts,'" (D'Ignazio & Klein, 2020)

## Response to the Prompts
While I have not been able to work on the KoBoToolbox tutorial, based on the readings, and the intentions behind the project I have a variety of insights to state. In regards to the format of the codes for recording the memorials, an obvious issue is in the assumption of the graves being christian, and how one would even know to classify a memorial as such, or as one of the specified denominations. In my case I had to make the assumption that since the cemetery I recorded was called the Saint Mary's Anglican Cemetery, the memorials were Anglican. In regards to the readings, there was a discussion regarding the addition/use of identifiers such as pronouns on memorials to better identify the deceased without people needing to make assumptions. I mentioned how some memorials, such as many of the ones I recorded, would be family memorials and list multiple people and their relationships, such as father, wife, daughter, etc. I think when discussing this kind of information being present on memorials you have to consider the intention behind a memorial. Is it for a larger remembrance, that the general public could view, is it for recording purposes, or perhaps, and most likely, it is for the private, personal benefit of the deceased's family, who would likely already know the details that additions such as pronouns would help identify. This line of thought circles back to the question of the ethics and morals surrounding the act of recording these memorials and the kind of impact this process could have. By cataloguing these memorials and adding them to the class made database, we are intentionally broadcasting what many may consider very personal information, to numerous people, and perhaps unintentionally to even more. Not to mention the fact that some of the information may be false, as it was made based on assumptions, or a lack of understanding, such as those who were unable to go to a site in person, like myself. These struggles and questions are very neatly summed up in the quote I chose for the resonance, "What is counted counts". This is the kind of idea that should be constantly in the thoughts of those who are working on data collection and presentation of any kind.
